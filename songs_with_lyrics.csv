1,Prisoner of Love,Perry Como,1946,207.2,christmas,https://www.songlyrics.com/perry-como/prisoner-of-love-lyrics/,"Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another, for I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another, for I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love"
2,To Each His Own,Eddy Howard,1946,184.293,big band,https://www.songlyrics.com/eddy-howard/to-each-his-own-lyrics/,"A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you
What good is a song if the words just don't belong?
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own
For me there's you
[Chorus]
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you
[Chorus]
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you"

The Gypsy
THE GYPSY
Ink Spots/Dinah Shore
- words and music by Billy Reid
- popularized by Fanny Rose Shore (better known as Dinah Shore)
- also a big hit for The Ink Spots
- recorded by Charlie ""Bird"" Parker in 1946 the same day he suffered
a breakdown caused by his drug addiction
In a quaint caravan
There's a lady they call The Gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears
Everything will come right
If you only believe The Gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears
She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe The Gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me some day

1,Near You,Francis Craig,1947,285.414,bollywood,https://www.songlyrics.com/francis-craig/near-you-lyrics/,"There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be, near you
Times when we're apart
I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away
If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content near you
Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days near you
There is just one place for me, I'm happy when I'm near you
It's wonderful as heaven, a special kind of heaven, but only when I'm near you
Times when we're apart I wonder how I can face my heart
Say you'll never stray
More than just two lips away
If my waking hours could be spent while near you
I would be content, wonderfully content, just to be near you
Make my life worthwhile
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days
All of those happy, happy days
So near you"

My pocket needs some money, so I can't go into town
My brother isn't working and my sister doesn't care
The car she needs a motor so I can't go anywhere
(Mañana, mañana, mañana is soon enough for me)
My mother's always working, she's working very hard
But every time she looks for me I'm sleeping in the yard
My mother thinks I'm lazy and maybe she is right
I'll go to work mañana but I gotta sleep tonight
(Mañana, mañana, mañana is soon enough for me)
Oh, once I had some money but I gave it to my friend
He said he'd pay me double, it was only for a lend
But he said a little later that the horse she was so slow
Why he give the horse my money is something I don't know
(Mañana, mañana, mañana is soon enough for me)
(Mañana, mañana, mañana is soon enough for me)
My brother took a suitcase and he went away to school
My father said he only learned to be a silly fool
My father said that I should learn to make a chile pot
But then I burned the house down, the chile was too hot
(Mañana, mañana, mañana is soon enough for me)
The window she is broken and the rain is comin' in
If someone doesn't fix it I'll be soaking to my skin
But if we wait a day or two the rain may go away
And we don't need a window on such a sunny day

Oba! Oba!

Miscellaneous
Now Is The Hour
NOW IS THE HOUR
Bing Crosby
(Scott, Kaihau)
- Bing recorded ""Now is the Hour"" and ""Silver Threads Among the Gold"" on
Nov. 8, 1947, without orchestral support. Bing's only accompaniment for
these songs were the voices of the Ken Darby Choir. Nevertheless, ""Now is
the Hour"" climbed to the top of the Billboard charts in 1948, where it stayed
for 3 weeks. The song remained on the charts an amazing 23 weeks. ""Now is
the Hour"" is based on a traditional New Zealand song ""Hearere Ra."" The song
turned out to be Bing's 42nd and last single to reach the top spot on the
pop charts. No one before or since has been able to come close to this
achievement.
Now is the hour
When we must say goodbye.
Soon you'll be sailing
Far across the sea.
While you're away
Oh, then, remember me.
When you return
You'll find me waiting here.
Sunset glow fades in the west.
Night o'er the valley is creeping.
Birds cuddle down in their nest
Soon all the world will be sleeping.
Now is the hour
When we must goodbye.
Soon you'll be sailing
Far across the sea.
While you're away
Oh, then, remember me.
When you return
You'll find me waiting here."

But if some day you should want to return
Please hurry back and we'll make a new start
Till then you're breaking my heart"

you'll remember yesterday
in its haunting strain
vienna lives again

of a half forgotten dream
seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme
Once again there comes to mind
someone that you left behind
love that somehow didn't last
in that happy city of the past
does she still recall the dream
that rapture so supreme
when first she heard the haunting third man theme?
Carnivals and carousels and ferris wheels and parasols
the danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
the zither's sweet refrain
keeps swirling in your brain
like new may wine
strauss waltzes, candle-glow
and the laughter of long ago
fill the magic chords and make it seem like today
You never knew that you could be
enchanted by a melody
the years will never drive it out
you don't know why
it's something you can't live without
you hear it in the twilight hush
and in the morning traffic rush
a song that's always new
in your heart a part of you
oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

I'm asking help me
Help me to see the world
Through baby eyes and hold me closely
I need a fresh start on the roller-coaster made for coasting
It's time to wake up
Time to make up
Time to shake these memories
It's time to leave the past in the past and lace up a new set of shoe strings
I want the world to know

Through up and down see
So we can sit together
Side by side through amazing

Give applause to what I can't control

I want to shine like that
I want to smile so big my daughter jumps into my lap
And I wanna tell her daddies fine and always plans to be

Never take them away boys
Don't take them away

The breezes joined in their sighs 
The blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed

She walks along the river in the quiet summer night

I promise to return and not to leave her so

We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily she'll loves me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forever more

Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew

Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of"
3,Lisbon Antigua,Nelson Riddle,1956,157.24,exotica,https://www.songlyrics.com/nelson-riddle/lisbon-antigua-lyrics/,"I gave my heart to you in old Lisbon that night,
Under the spell of your charms,
I felt your arms hold me so tight;
`Twas heaven to find such bliss in each kiss;
I lost my heart but I found one so true,
In old Lisbon with you.
It happened one night in Portugal
Lisbon was gay in the moonlight,
The stars were shining above 
When I found you, my love;
What is this strangeness, this splendor,
All this myst'ry that makes me surrender?
Lisboa antigua reposa
llena de encanto y belleza
que fuiste hermosa al sonreir
y al vestir tan airosa!
El velo de la nostalgia
cubrirà tu rostro
de linda princesa.
No volveràs
Lisboa antigua y senorial
a ser morada feudal
a tu esplendor real.
Las fiestas y los lùcidos saraos
y serenatas al amanecer
ya nunca volveràn"

We passed the time away
Writing love letters in the sand
How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand
You made a vow that you would ever be true
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you
Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand"

(banjo intro)
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood by our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast

Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care for it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams
All their love
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms"

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true

That when she left that day

For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my hearts somewhere far away
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day

Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow

She almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh!
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah

I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a-tumblin' down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving and goin' nowhere
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, help me please
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I know I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere"

And biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know
They will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love
The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know
That I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, what
can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a star
But I, would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love"

I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

But friend, it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran
Out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed 'til I cried
She was always young at heart
Kind a dumb and kind a smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when
I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say, she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly in middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robin's sing, she went away
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes, one day while I wasn't home
While she was there and all alone, the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes over head
And cries down in the flower bed that honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown"

Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
Make sweet love to you
Singin' now
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high night flier and a rainbow rider
A straight-shootin' son of a gun
I said a straight shootin' son of a gun
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the world
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me"

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these, these days"

There's something wrong here there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin' or maybe we've just stopped tryin'
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh, no-no-no-no
(no-no-no-no)
It used to be so easy livin' here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
And it's too late baby now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it

Something inside has died and I can't hide it and I just can't fake it
Oh, no-no

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

Though we really did try to make it

I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies, my love
To the dark and the endless skies
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command, my love
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love
And it will last till the end of time, my love
The first time ever I saw your face, your face
Your face, your face"

3,American Pie,Don McLean,1972,516.893,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/don-mclean/american-pie-lyrics/,"A long, long time ago, I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside the day the music died
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang 'Dirges In The Dark'
The day the music died
We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
Landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die"

Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware of a man named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy, more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him Treetop Lover
All the men just call him Sir
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Now Leroy, he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a .32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Well, Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris and ooh, that girl looked nice
Well, he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
'Cause Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Well, the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damned town
Badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog
Yeah, badder than old King Kong
And meaner than a junkyard dog"

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me
He was strong in my face
Yeah he was seeing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song"
1,The Way We Were,Barbra Streisand,1974,211.093,adult standards,https://www.songlyrics.com/barbra-streisand/the-way-we-were-lyrics/,"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me would we, could we
Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were"
2,Seasons in the Sun,Terry Jacks,1974,208.853,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/terry-jacks/seasons-in-the-sun-lyrics/,"Goodbye Emil, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and A, B, C's
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Goodbye Emil, it's hard to die
When all the bird's are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
I wish we could both be there
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills we could climb
Were just seasons out of time
Goodbye Papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to show me right from wrong
But too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the bird's are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little kids are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song
Like the seasons have all gone
Goodbye Francoise, my trusted wife
Without you I'd had a lonely life
You cheated lots of times with them
But I forgave you in the end
Though your lover was my friend
Goodbye Francoise, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With your lovers everywhere
Just be careful, I'll be there
We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach
Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me joy and helped me find the sun
And every time when I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground"

Play our love's theme once more
Make him feel, like him felt before
While the lights are low
Please, let the music flow
And I just know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me, Love's theme

Once we sip the wine

Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away
Like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token
And a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Baby, I lose my head
And in a world of people there's only you and I

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night

Give me more, drag me across the floor

All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you, make it shine, make it rain
Baby, I know my way
I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breathe when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you
Do it light, taking me through the night

And fill my nights with song
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home
Finally, a chance to say hey, I love you
Never again to be all alone
'Cause you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

You light up my days

When doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
Don't cry
Oh yeah all right, oh yeah oh yeah

When doves cry, when doves cry

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ooo
When doves cry, don't cry

Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry"
2,What's Love Got to Do with It,Tina Turner,1984,226.88,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/tina-turner/whats-love-got-to-do-with-it-lyrics/,"You must understand
Though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I read it some place
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
I've been taking on a new direction
And I have to say
I've been thinking 'bout my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken"

1,Careless Whisper,Wham!,1985,299.8,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/wham/careless-whisper-lyrics/,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance's kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
What am I without your love?
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?"

Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel, shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was getting cold
Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Feels so good inside
When you hug me
And your heartbeats, and you love me"

Something ain't right

What you did last night
You left me sleeping in my bed
I was dreaming
but I should've been with you instead.

That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt
A voice was crying out
Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand, some one who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say, ""I'll show you""
Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together
Naturally
So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believing who you are, you are a shining star
Say you, say me, say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me, say it together

Say it together

Then I turned around to say that I loved you
then I realized
that it was just my mind
playing tricks on me...
It seems colder lately at night
and I try to sleep with the lights on
Everytime the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe
That we're through...
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...
Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
But it's our first love...
all the feelings that we used to share...
I refuse to believe that you don't care.
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now
be strong
I can't believe that you're gone...
I've got to carry on.
I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
Theres no other way to say it
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
It's driving me crazy
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
That you're part of me now

It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you.

They do the sand dance, don't you know
If they move too quick (oh way oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh way oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh way oh)
You drop your drink
Then they bring you more
All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh way oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian
All the kids in the marketplace say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Slide your feet up the street
Bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh way oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac
If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh way oh)
They spin the clubs cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh way oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian
All the cops in the donut shop say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
and I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown
Alone
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
Alone, alone"

If I could touch your body

Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith

I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Because I got to have faith

in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did the words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
...
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
...
Every rose has its thorn
...
Yeah it does
...
I listen to our favorite song
playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and
...
easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here somehow
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess
...
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains
Solo
...
I know I could have saved a love that night
...
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love
We both made our separate ways
But now I hear you found somebody new
and that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess

Is it really fair to feel this way inside?
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day
You could sustain or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness
You got yourself into your own mess
Lettin' your worries pass you by
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free the chains
Yeah, I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
If you hold on?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
If you hold on
Can you hold on?
Hold on baby
Won't you tell me now
Hold on for one more day
'Cause, It's gonna go your way
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can't you change it this time?
Make up your mind
Hold on
Hold on
Baby, hold on"
2,It Must Have Been Love,Roxette,1990,259.665,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/roxette/it-must-have-been-love-lyrics/,"It must have been love but it's over now
Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside, I turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been love but it's over now"

Miscellaneous
Nothing Compares 2 U
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since u took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since u took your love away
Since u been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner if a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U
It's been so lonely without u here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better have fun no matter what u do
but he's a fool
'Cos nothing compares 2 U
All the flowers that u planted mama
In the back yard
All died when u went away
I knew that living with u baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
'Cos nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U"

Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Still I can't let you go

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I
Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead just come to my bed

I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby

It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back
Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection
Thirty six-twenty- four-thirty six
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back
Baby got back
(Little in the middle but she got much back)
(Little in the middle but she got much back)
(Little in the middle but she got much back)

Close your eyes, make a wish
And blow out the candlelight
For tonight is just your night
We're gonna celebrate, all through the night
Pour the wine, light the fire
Girl your wish is my command

I will do anything, girl you need only ask
I'll make love to you

Girl are you ready, it's gon' be a long night
Throw your clothes on the floor

Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast."

For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up, never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you
You were my strength when I was weak

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned our long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And you footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will"

Pieces of you
you were meant for me
i hear the clock, it's six a.m. / i feel so far from where i've been / got my eggs and my pancakes too / got my maple syrup, everything but you
break the yolks, make a smiley face / i kinda like it in my brand new place / i wipe the spots off of the mirror / don't leave the keys in the door / never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you
called my momma, she was out for a walk / consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk / picked up a paper, it was more bad news / more hearts being broken or people being used
put on my coat in the pouring rain / saw a movie it just wasn't the same / 'cause it was happy and i was sad / it made me miss you oh so bad
dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you
go about my business, i'm doing fine / besides, what would i say if i had you on the line / same old story, not much to say / hearts are broken every day
brush my teeth and put the cap back on / i know you hate it when i leave the light on / i pick a book up / turn the sheets down / take a deep breath and a good look around
put on my pj's and hop into bed / i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead / i try and tell myself it'll all be alright / i just shouldn't think anymore tonight
dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you"

  It's not hard to see, the boy is mine
  I'm sorry that you, seem to be confused
  He belongs to me, the boy is mine
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake him for your man
Are you insane?
See I know that you may be just a bit jealous of me
'Cause' you're blind
If you can't see that his love is all in me
See I try to hesistate, I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make through the day
Ain't that a shame
Maybe you misunderstood, plus I can't see
How he could wanna take time and that's all good
All of my love was all it took
(repeat)
Must you do the things you do keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you well
If you didn't know it girl, it's true
I think that you should realize and try to understand why
He is a part of my life, I know its killing you inside
You can say what, you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
You're the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine if you didn't know the boy is mine
(rpt 1)
You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to special places in my heart
It was my lovin' from the start?

The whole world just fades away

Is the beating of your heart

It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know

But you stay so cool
My MuÃ±equita, my Spanish Harlem, Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it
But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, hell
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, hell
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it
Let's don't forget about it, no, no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, no, no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it, no, no, no
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it"

Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you
There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That can change my mind
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
I'm desperate for changing
I'm starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you
Just hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment
Hanging by a moment here with you"

In love with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me blue

Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh, oh, oh
Never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain
Just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I loved you
Oh baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no

No, no

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

You said you loved me, no one above me
And I was all you had
And though my heart is beating for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how
I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

And you are always gone
And boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years
See my days are cold without you

I keep on running back to you
Oohhhhh
I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad
What love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
Too all of my ladies (ladies) feel me
C'mon sing wit me
See, when I get the strength to leave you
Always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that may be
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(never gonna change, never gonna change)
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me
Boy I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
See something always hold me back"

Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a ****, it's not your birthday
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's always drama in da club
N***** I heard I roll with Dre, everybody show me love
When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love
But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that ****** roll that **** up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few ****** but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying, ""50, you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York they surely will tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused, man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend willin' to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look homey, I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Oh you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar, toasting to the good life
Moved out the hood, now trying to pull me back, right?
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you're talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me
'Cause go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
Then watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside their head with a bottle of bub
Come on, they know where we be
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you don't know
Where we been neither
We in the club all the time

See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same by myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel, I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
Deep down you know its best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
I'm twisted 'cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh can ya feel me burnin'?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else

We know that it's through

Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
I know that life's a bore
So full of the superficial
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
â€~Cause I didn't know you
â€~Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
â€~Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, â€~cause baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
And it's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
â€~Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby
We belong together"

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just ahead of the law
You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Oh. Holiday.)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day"

Nope
Didnt think so
How you doin young lady
That feelin that you givin really drivin' me crazy
You dont have ta play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
If you looking for a girl thatll treat you right
If you lookin for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
Whats the problem I dont see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
Im curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy Im tired of running, let's walk for a minute
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
Im all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That Im all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, are you ready?
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through
Im out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game I'm a lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely Ima need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team, so does everybody else
Baby, we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down aint nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Hey, Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on, you know what I mean
Girl, Im a freak you shouldn't say those things
Im only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
Im all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy the way you're making me wait

And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time? And
It's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you

Because you was untrue

And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(The sweet escape)
If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)
I want to get away to our sweet escape
I want to get away, yeah

I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vain
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love"

Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright
And no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time, I'm telling you that in the world
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you"

Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I
Ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I've lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
And I wonder if I
Ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I've lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt
Than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone
And I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby, I need you now"

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you is the only drug I need
So gangsta, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see, I can be myself now finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know

Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out
And I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all, it all

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hands

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, oh
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, oh
You're gonna leave 'em falling downYou don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, oh
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, oh
You're gonna leave 'em falling down
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (now you're just somebody that I used to know)
I used to know
That I used to know
I used to know

Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out?
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh"

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud
So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Then maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you win the better place
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I'll see you again
When I'll see you again
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take, will always lead you home, ooh ooo oh
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Aah oh
Aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
When I see you again
See you again
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"
2,Sorry,Justin Bieber,2016,200.786,NA,https://www.songlyrics.com/justin-bieber/sorry-lyrics/,"You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, no I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
